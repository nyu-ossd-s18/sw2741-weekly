**Open source** (what do YOU think about when you hear the term "open source"? what are some advantages of open vs. closed source, what are some potential problems with open source?)

**Projects**: list names of four open source projects that you regularly use or that influenced you in some way in the past; give brief descriptions for each, explain why you use it and what the alternatives might be (note, the projects do not have to be source code based)  

**Questions for Tom**: come up with two (or more) questions that you would like to ask Tom Callaway from RedHat when he visits the class next week   

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. 
Go into /_posts/ and update the 2018-01-28-week01.md file.
