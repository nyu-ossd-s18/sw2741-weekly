1. How you selected the article to contribute to

Wikipedia provides a comprehensive list of articles that need copy editing by month. I simply selected a random month then read through several of the articles listed that sounded interested. I didn't think that I could contribute any meaningful content to any of the articles so I opted for finding articles that needed obvious fixes with grammar/formatting. I ended up with a half dozen options to choose from and ultimately went with the article that interested me the most in terms of content. 


2. What the contribution was

I ended up contributing to an article titled "GTA Gang" and made several minor contributions to it. The majority of the changes I made was regarding the formatting of the date. For example, there was a mix of "5 January 2018" and "January 5, 2018" formats, so I streamlined all the dates to be in the latter format. I made a few grammatical changes to the article and fixed some awkward wording, and changed the formatting for one of the headers.
