# Summary of Team Assessment and Plan 

Our team has the advantage of being comprised primarily of members who have already worked with Django in the past; as a result, we have a idea of what Django excels at and what it may be lacking in. One disadvantage might be that the majority of us are relatively inexperienced with contributing to open source software, which will make for an interesting learning experience for all five of us. The common meeting time we've decided on is Thursdays from 5-7 pm, with our alternative time slot being Tuesday from 5-7pm. Personally, I believe a our milestones will be to first find an easy contribution we can make just to get our feet wet with contributing, then once it's been approved continue with relatively easy contributions until we feel comfortable enough to work on more difficult issues.
