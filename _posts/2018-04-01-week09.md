#Group Progress 

As a group we met up this week to continue monitoring Django for easy tickets and tickets in general that we may be able to do that were simply not labeled "easy". We found a couple of potentially viable tickets but none that we can say for certain that we can make a pull request for. We have also looked through alternative projects but although we've sifted through a lot of projects, most seem to have a significant lack of easy issues. As an individual, I am able to actively participate and my specific task for this week was to look through alternative tickets along with Kelly. We have compiled a list of potential projects in our meeting minutes and will decide as a group whether we want to change to a new project or stick with Django.
