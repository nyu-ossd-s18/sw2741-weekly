# Group Progress 

As a team we've finally made our first pull request for the updated password list. We have also asked the Django team for clarification for further tests that need to be made and moving forward, we will create tests if needed and fix any issues that may arise. In addition, we will be looking into more Django tickets that may be suitable for our skill level and looking into triaging some issues for Django as well. As an individual this week, I took minutes for one of our group meetings as well as attempted to run tests for our program (but ultimately was unsuccessful due to issues that arose with Python that remain unresolved).
