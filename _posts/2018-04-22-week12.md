# Group Progress 

This week as a group we continued to look for more contributions we could make to Django as we made our first pull request last week. For the most part we looked into triaging and issues with documentation but it was difficult to find anything substantial. I followed up on an issue that was made 25 days ago that should have been closed but has not yet and asked for a status update (though I might end up counting this towards my own small contributions). As of now, we are still looking into triaging code.
