# Reflection of the Course 

Overall, I thought that this coure was a good introduction to open source projects - it was great to learn that the barrier to contributing to open source doesn't have to be high and that contributions are not limited to code contributions. On the other hand, I felt as if more of the class should have been focused on making signficant contributons instead of trivial ones. In addition, although we went over the basics of git and linux commands, I felt that there were a lot of subteleties and things that could go wrong when making pull requests, and wished we had covered that more (considering our ultimate goal was to make a pull request). 

I don't think anything we covered in course was unnecessary, but I do wish we had gotten some more practice weith the things we were taught (git, linux commands, etc). One thing that I wish we covered a lot more and worked with more is humanitarian open source projects. This was the topic that I was most interested in when it came to open source and there are so great projects out there that I wish we as a class could have contributed to.
